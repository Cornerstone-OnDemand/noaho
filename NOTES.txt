Pros:
- Doesn't crash
- Adds a payload
- Does unicode and str in Python 2, and unicode in 3 (it's all UCS4 under the hood)
- Can be used commercially, as it has a freer license than the GPL
- Does the 'compilation' (generation of failure links) on-demand

Cons:
- Uses more memory
- Probably slower (did I mention it doesn't crash, and works with Unicode?)
- Requires a C++ compiler
- Does not allow overlap (could perhaps add it but...)
- Does not have the equivalent of 'chases'

clean up comments
make a setup.py that doesn't do Cython
check the 'out U out + out(failure)' thing...

if we're going to be perfectionist we should use the 'advance the pointer'
  method; it takes complexity out of the find_... routines.
# rename package to yaaho
# maybe make find_all -> findall and longest -> long
# get rid of state preservation (we don't care)
# get rid of debug statements
# Make it on-demand 'make'ing
# rename stuff
# add str support
# add one-off support


to test:
memory leak, with payloads
overlaps; containment
# payloads
# Look up Danny Yoo's tests, steal + adapt for our own.
