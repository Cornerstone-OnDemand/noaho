Description: NoAho
Does fast, simultaneous multi-keyword search using the Aho Corasick
algorithm, except that if keywords overlap in the target text, only
the first appearing, or first+longest one will be found. In addition
you can associate any Python object with each keyword (it supports
much of the mapping protocol), and works for Python 2.7 (at least -
maybe earlier) for any mixture of str and unicode types, and 3.x.
