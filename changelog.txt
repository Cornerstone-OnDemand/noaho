2015-02-17, 0.9.5
* Fixed bug where find_longest took the /last/ key-match from a contiguous
  sequence of key-matches, rather than the longest one.
* Updated to Cython 22.0 for no reason.

2014-05-01, 0.9.4
* Incorporated setup.py change from Balthazar Roubero to make it install
  properly with pip.
* Dropped the initial directory name from the noaho module, ie,
  previously you'd import noaho.noaho, now it's just import noaho.
* Cleaned up the code and docs some, re-built with Cython 20.1
